Hi! Iâ€™m Andrei, graduated in Economics at University of Padova (Italy).

Iâ€™m passionate about computer science and programming. Iâ€™m also a Recognized Developer and Contributor at XDA-Developers forum, where I use to develop custom software for Android devices in Java/Smali (Dex Bytecode).

This is my personal website where Iâ€™ll be publishing posts about information security, Android software reverse engineering and more.

If you need to contact me, feel free to send an email to *andrei.conache[at]protonmail.com*.
